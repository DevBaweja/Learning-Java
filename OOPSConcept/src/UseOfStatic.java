public class UseOfStatic {

//	static variables are used when we want to initialise things only once 
//	ie there varibales are properties of class itself and not object
//	
//	static variables are used to maybe count number of object initialised 
//	
//	An non-static variable is declared every time when an object is created
//	and it will store different values accordingly to the object itself
//	but static variables are declared once with class and have same value for every object
//	
//	
//	
//	// When with functions 
//	an static or non-static method can access static variables as static variable is defined for class (only once)
//	
//	but non-static variable can only be accessed in non-static method as non-static variables are for object itself
//	
//	What you cannot access is non-static variable  from static method 
//	// for non-static variable you need object of which that variables is
